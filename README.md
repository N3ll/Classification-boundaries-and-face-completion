# Classification boundaries and face completion

Applying k-nearest neighbor classifier and then visualizing the boundaries between the defined clusters.

Comparison how differnt models could be trained to complete images of faces. Algorithms used: ExtraTreesRegressor, KNeighborsRegressor, Linear regression, RidgeCV.

## Dataset

The datasets used (**iris**, **olivatti face**) are directly imported in the notebook from sklearn.datasets.

## Python version

Python 2
